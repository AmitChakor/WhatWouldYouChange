Objective:
	Review the ExampleProgram console application. Do not modify or refactor the code. Instead describe any changes 
	you think should be made in the section below. Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this entire assignment.
        Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.


Suggested Changes:

Issue found :

In the Program.cs class file under the Main Class on below line.
exampleClass.ExampleMethod("ExampleTexttxt");

here the parrametter passed as "ExampleTexttxt" isent correct which makes the ExampleMethod() class to run into a catcch block throwing an exception for the same.

Solution :

The method call found as issue above should be replaced as below 
	exampleClass.ExampleMethod("ExampleText.txt");

here I have added a "." seperator in the parametter name as seen above to seperate the file extenssion from the file name to be recognised.
Now the Example Method will not run into an exception through Catch block and whll give the resulre output by executing the try 
block as it can now find the named file with proper extenssion and read from the same.

Also I would replace the code in the catch block to catch an exception like checking if the file exists insted of appending strings to a text variable .
